# Make Me Stand!
A macOS status menu app that automatically triggers the IDÃ…SEN powered standing desk periodically throughout the day.

## Pre-requisites
1. Requires you to own the compatible powered desk with Linak [DPG..] BLE controller.

## Usage
1. Configure an automatic stand/sit interval to match your preferences -- e.g., 5 minutes of standing each hour near the end of the hour.
2. Configure the AFK timer so automatic stand/sit will disable automatically if you are away from the computer (based on no mouse/keyboard activity) for more than x minutes.  Ghost buster ðŸ˜€
3. Launch on demand, or set it to launch on login.
4. Connect&Pair to your preferred desk and enable autoconnect for the next launch.

## End User Installation
Not available yet.

## Developer Installation
Build and run in Xcode.

## Project Status
I cobbled this together as a side project just for fun.

I wanted to explore writing tests for code that interacts with a BLE device, using the Blueconnect library.
